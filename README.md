# Kirby Pong

* Player 1 is on the left of the screen and player 2 is on the right.
* Press `t` to toggle between single and multiplayer mode.
* Press `1`, `2`, or `3` to toggle between the number of active balls.

## Note for grader
If the program takes a relatively longer time to load (because the computer is lagging or because the computer is asking for permission to access files), the ball will collide with a paddle and the paddle will not have a chance to hit it. This causes the ball and paddle to glitch together. Please try re-running the program if this happens! This has happened to me a handful of times but I don't think it's a fault of my code and instead a fault of the machine running it.
